      <h3 class="fc-w">About me:</h3>

      <p class="fc-w">
        My journey to computer science has been a unique one.
        I started programming without really knowing that I was, on my TI-84 calculator in middle school because I was bored.
        I did not think of programming as a possible career until much later.
        I was working as an accountant’s assistant and taught myself VBA to automate most of my work.
        I learned so much from that experience, like how to learn code on my own, and that I hated accounting but loved programming.
        I went on to take an intro Java class at school and knew computer science was what I wanted to do.
        I have tried to learn as much as I could from my programming classes in school, and to apply the things I learned to personal projects.
        I have also tried to gain exposure to the field by attending every tech talk and computer science related event that I could.
        These things have taught me a lot, and shown me that I still have a lot to learn.
      </p>

      <p class="fc-w">
        I have spent a lot of time trying to figure out what I want to do with my life.
        In high school I was passionate about theater, singing, art, and at the same time, calculus and physics.
        When I started college I decided to study mechanical engineering so I could build and create.
        After a year of that I switched to machining so I could work with my hands.
        I then took two years off and traveled to a small island about 500 miles from Madagascar, called La Réunion.
        There I learned to speak French and Réunionais Créole while I served and interacted with the people.
        When I returned home, I still felt directionless.
        I wanted to continue to help and interact with people so I planned to go into psychology.
        I then changed my mind and went into accounting for a time which led me to computer science.
        So here I am. I’ve been to the other side of the world, climbed a volcano, interned twice at Google, sang in front of large audiences, hiked a few hundred miles on the Appalachian trail, learned some languages, and fell in love.
        Life has been pretty good.
